<h1>LAST PRAIRIE AND THE PLANET</h1>
</div>
<div class="blog-body">
<p>
Last Prairie exists because this fragile earth deserves a voice. It needs solutions. It needs change. It needs action.<br>Around the globe, we are standing up for our communities, and we are holding governments and corporations accountable. Our Planet - a pale blue dot on the vast canvas of the universe, is fast approaching a point of no return. In the current world order, materialism supersedes human values, economy is more treasured than ecology and profits are prioritized over people. This ceaseless demand for more is pushing our soil, air, water, food, forests and climate closer to an inevitable collapse. Last Prairie exists because of activists, supporters, donors and volunteers who believe in taking collective action for the environment. Our planet needs us more than ever - individuals, communities and groups who have the power to shift the paradigm.Last Prairie is undergoing an important restructuring. For several years now, we have been supported by an able and committed team involved with raising public awareness on environmental issues and raising funds for the organisation. Over the years, this team has helped us inspire more than 3,00,000 individual supporters to join our mission and help us stay financially stable and independent. Under our new restructured model these critical functions have now been outsourced.
